# useState vs useReducer

## What is useState?
useState is a hook that allows you to manage state in a functional component. It returns a stateful value and a function to update it. You can call this function from an event handler or somewhere else. It is similar to this.setState in a class, except it doesnâ€™t merge the old and new state together.

## What is useReducer?
useReducer is a hook that is used for state management. It is an alternative to useState. It accepts a reducer function with the application initial state, returns the current application state, then dispatches a function.
